# wiki_pedia
in this project I have used bottom navigation and navigation drawer concepts. I have also set collapsing toolbar mode for one of the fragments of bot nav menu that its pic vanishes when you scroll up the screen that sounds prefetionally!
there are some cards view that if you click on them, you can go to the real news on wikipedia web(wich the name of the app comes from...)
you can also see the news which are trended in the middle fragment.
I have set 2 external classes wich ca understand that if the net or vpn are connected or not.
in addition I did my best to obey the rules of material3 in my design.hope ypu enjoy it.
